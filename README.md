idea?
- some code to facilitate training and using transformer models as agents in novel environment in ways similar to existing

notes:
- hf decisiontransformer with multiple rewards
- environment callback that simplifies openai gym into a function with self-documenting action and observation parameters
- process recorded data

missing:
- primarily, actually _training_ a decision transformer. it would be fun to adapt a language model around properties of its outputs.
      but it would likely make sense to go through the huggingface tutorial on decision transformers.
- some things
